# Dimensionality-reduction-of-spatial-proteomics-data

The project reviews and illustrates the application of t-distributed Stochastic Neighborhood Embedding(t-SNE) for data visualization purposes. The theory behind t-SNE is briefly discussed and a popular data set (MNIST) was used to compare the performance of t-SNE with PCA for data visualization purposes. Furthermore, spatial-temporal viral proteomic data was used to illustrate the proper application of t-SNE. The procedure of optimizing and choosing the hyperparameters (perplexity and the maximum number of iterations) for the t-SNE algorithm is discussed. Finally, the multi-dimensional spatial-temporal viral proteomic data was visualized in two-dimensions using the optimized parameters of t-SNE.
